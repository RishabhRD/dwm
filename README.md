# dwm (Rishabh's build of Dynamic Window Manager)

My build of DWM contains the latest dwm core with important patches applied. In addition to those, some i3wm features are added using native C-code.

## Patches

- alpha

- floatrules

- gaps

- hide vacant tags

- pertag

- removeborder

- restartsig (Will remove soon!!)

- scratchpads

## Is dwm fastest WM?

No. dwm is not the fastest window manager in my experience.

## Then why use dwm?

Because it's most efficient window manager for any programmer's workflow. Focus on programming not window managing.

Also, it fits in Unix philosphy not like i3wm that becomes a single point of failure(i.e., bloat)

## Why use my build?

Because you will have to do approx zero effort in managing windows then onwards!! Focus only on your work not windows.
