# dwm (Rishabh's build of Dynamic Window Manager)

My build of DWM contains the latest dwm core with important patches applied. In addition to those, some i3wm features are added using native C-code.

## Patches

- alpha

- floatrules

- gaps

- hide vacant tags

- pertag

- removeborder

- restartsig (Will remove soon!!)

- scratchpads

## Is dwm fastest WM?

No. DWM is not fastest window manager in my experience.

## Then why use dwm?

dwm is most extensible WM. Anyone can extend it using patches and C-programming. It fits in our workflow and reduces the effort to manage window than any other window manager.

Also, it fits in Unix philosphy not like i3wm that becomes a single point of failure(i.e., bloat)

## Why use my build?

Because you will have to do approx 0 effort in managing windows then onwards!! Focus only on your work not windows.
