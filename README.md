# dwm (Rishabh's build of Dynamic Window Manager)

My build of DWM contains the latest dwm core with important patches applied. In
addition to those, some i3wm features are added using native C-code.

## Patches

- hide vacant tags

- pertag

- removeborder

- restartsig (Will remove soon!!)

- scratchpads

- fullscreen

- colorbar

- sticky

## Why use DWM?

Any tiling window manager automatically tiles the window in right place and
enhances your workflow significantly.  DWM's way of dynamic window management
does the same but you have to put very less effort on window management in
comparision to any other window manager. It's even extensible using patches
available on their website.  You can always hack into their code to extend the
window manager your own way. And believe me doing this in other window managers
is a very tedious job.


## What about my build?

I find my build to contain all patches most people would want to have.  It does
not contain many fancy patches to decorate window manager or introduce other
philosphy of window management. This is a minimal build of dwm that everyone
needs in general.

My build also includes some keybinds that would make you press less variety of
keys to acheive similar tasks. This makes those tasks to be significantly
faster to operate with hands.
